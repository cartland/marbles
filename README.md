# Marbles

I wanted to create a computer out of wood and marbles,
but those take up space and make a lot of noise.
Instead I'm playing around with Unity to create a
physical simulation that can multiply two small
unsigned binary integers by rolling marbles
through some carfully placed levers and ramps.

The computational complexity of this algorithm is really bad.
A pencil and paper would be much faster.
